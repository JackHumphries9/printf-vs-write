<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project makes more sense if you've read my blog article on the subject: [https://jackhumphries.io/blog/printf-is-magic-and-mysterious](https://jackhumphries.io/blog/printf-is-magic-and-mysterious)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This project is written in C and heavily relies on GCC to compile and run. (You can use Clang if you want, but I haven't tested it.)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Build the project:

```sh
$ ./scripts/build.sh
```

Then run the harness:

```sh
$ python3 harness.py
```
